/// Port of Communication/J2534/Uds/PatchBlockRunner.cs, itself ported from
/// VW_Flash (bri3d, BSD 2-Clause) lib/flash_uds.py: patch_block().
///
/// This is the actual delivery mechanism for the CBOOT-bypass unlock patch
/// (see Flash/CbootPatcher.swift) and is the single highest-stakes code path
/// in this whole port - it's the step that writes the exploit payload
/// itself. Deliberately kept as its own function, not folded into
/// FlashBlockRunner, because it differs from a normal block flash in
/// several ways that matter:
///
///   - Always erases block 5 (CAL) before writing, regardless of which
///     block is actually being patched. This is not a mistake carried over
///     from FlashBlockRunner - it's what the original does, on purpose (the
///     comment in the Python: "Hardcoded to erase block 5 (CAL) prior to
///     patch. This means we must ALWAYS flash CAL after patching."). Skipping
///     the subsequent CAL flash after running this leaves the ECU with an
///     erased CAL.
///   - Uses compression=0x0 (NOT LZSS-compressed, unlike normal blocks) with
///     encryption=0xA.
///   - Uses a variable, address-dependent transfer chunk size specific to
///     the exact patch binary's byte layout (see
///     Simos18ModuleInfo/Simos1810ModuleInfo.blockTransferSizesPatch).
///   - Retries indefinitely on a negative UDS response for each TransferData
///     chunk, incrementing the counter and waiting 25ms between attempts -
///     there is no retry cap here, matching the Python exactly. This is a
///     real, disclosed risk: a persistent failure here hangs indefinitely
///     rather than surfacing an error. Callers driving a UI should apply
///     their own external cancellation/timeout around this call rather than
///     assume it will always return.
